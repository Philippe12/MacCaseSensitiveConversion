# The (new) case of Mac Case-Sensitivity

You probably know the story: Unix folks prefer their file systems case-sensitive, and the Mac OS
Installer lets you readily have your way. Life is good. Until you want to run software like Steam
([no more workaround possible](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/2/1698294337767925853/)) or
Creative Cloud (painful partial workaround). And since you landed here, you're likely tired of running
into the same old traps over and over again, and considering to go back to a case-insensitive HFS+ startup
volume on your Mac.

Over the years there have been various hacks reported on the Internet for this, but every one I could find
either does not work at all on Mac OS X "El Capitan" 10.11 or later, or involves commercial software
like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper. However, if you're comfortable using the command line, there
is a way using just onboard, standard tools. (Thanks to @kylehovey, this method has been confirmed
still working on Mac OS X "High Sierra" 10.13.4 and @nmasnadithya confirmed that it works on Mojave with APFS as well.)

Since it took a very long weekend to figure out all the little obstacles, there might be value in
sharing the recipe that finally worked for me in the end. In a nutshell:

 1. Resolve **all** case-sensitivity naming conflicts
 2. Make a fresh TimeMachine backup
 3. Flip the backups's case-sensitivity flag
 4. Restore from the manipulated backup

This how-to is kept deliberately vague in areas that are second nature to command line geeks. If you
have a hard time filling-in the detail, you may want to get help from a good friend for this
endeavor anyway.

Before you start you should temporarily disable disk encryption, for it would slow down the process
considerably and complicate a few of the steps if left enabled (and it would be up to you to figure them out).

## 1. Resolve case-sensitivity naming conflicts

A case-sensitive file system treats *Foo* and *foo* as distinct files, but you won't be able to have
both in the same directory on a case-insensitive file system. The moment TimeMachine attempts to restore a
conflicting file or directory that is has already put in place, it will bluntly abort the whole process with
a generic error message that leaves you without any clue about what went wrong or what file caused the
naming collision.

Hence you must clean your **complete** startup disk of any case conflicts. Unfortunately, this is a
laborious and manual process and I don't know of any tool that can do the work for you all the way.
However, this repository contains two python scripts that can (hopefully) spot conflicting files
for you. However, dealing with them in a clever way is completely up to you.

What I did on my system was the following:

```bash
$ cd /
$ sudo <path_to_script>/casecheck.py
```

This produced a nightmarishly long list of conflicts that had to be resolved one by one. In my case,
there were two areas that required special handling. Depending on what programs you use (I expected
lots of conflict potential for my photo database, but it looks like Aperture had it figured out), you
may need to use their tooling to fix their databases and directories. In fact, where possible, you
should use the user interface of those programs instead of manipulating their files and directories
directly on the command line.

This repo also contains the script ```casecheck_extra.py```, based on my mostly untested quick&dirty
implementation of Apple's *FastUnicodeCompare* algorithm used by HFS+. The algorithm
skips certain "ignorable characters" that a regular Unicode string comparison would treat as different.
It didn't spot any leftovers on my disk, so the script is there mostly for completeness. Feel free to
use it instead of ```casecheck.py``` and let me know how it goes.

### iTunes

Most conflicts occurred in my iTunes collection, because capitalization of artist, album and track names
were all over the place. I found it best to normalize capitalization through iTunes directly, and it
would move files appropriately (IIRC there's a pref for that, be sure to enable it). iTunes then neatly takes
care of potential collisions. **Just make sure that you normalize both *Artist* and *Album Artist* for each
affected track**, or else files might remain in conflicting artist directories.

### System files

Mac OS won't let you change anything the */System* folder from within the running system (not even as root),
but on my disk there were several conflicts in that tree. To resolve these, you need to:

 1. Boot into the recovery system by holding *Command-R* on the boot chime
 1. Open the Terminal app from the menu
 1. Resolve conflicts on the startup volume mounted in /Volume/YOUR_DISK_NAME/System/...

Where possible I chose to dele the older file and in case of my duplicate *Plugin* directory, I
moved the content from one over into the other and deleted the empty directory left behind. So far I
encountered no issues with those decisions.

## 2. Make a fresh TimeMachine backup

It is very hard to overstate this:

**Make a fresh backup for this conversion.**

**Also, make another backup to another drive that you won't touch until you're certain beyond a doubt
that the conversion succeeded.**

You will need a reliable fallback in case you don't manage to clear every last one of the
case-sensitivity conflicts, and you will only really find out whether you succeeded when the restore
fails – or not.

I trust you know how to create a fresh TimeMachine backup. The new backup disk needs to be
case-sensitive for TimeMachine to do its thing, and that's okay. Make sure no important folders
are on the exception list for your backups.

I suggest you let TimeMachine take just a single snapshot. If you end up with multiple snapshots
when the backup ran over night, for example, you may want to delete the older snapshots. The folder
`/Volumes/<BACKUPVOLUME>/Backups.backupdb/<COMPUTERNAME>/` contains all the snapshots encoded by
date plus one symbolic link pointing to the lastest one.

```bash
$ ls -l /Volumes/TimeMachiiine/Backups.backupdb/tin/
total 9
drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  204 29 Aug 10:04 2016-08-29-100422/
drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  204 29 Aug 11:05 2016-08-29-110526/
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   17 29 Aug 11:08 Latest -> 2016-08-29-110526
```

Mind that my backup volume is called ``TimeMachiiine`` and my computer's name is ``tin``. Change
those accordingly to match your situation. Delete all snapshots but the latest one with something
like:

```bash
$ tmutil delete /Volumes/TimeMachiiine/Backups.backupdb/tin/2016-08-29-100422
```

That snapshot will be gone with all of TimeMachine's metadata still intact.

**Never use ``rm -rf`` or anything to that effect for manipulating the backup. Things will likely break.**

## 3. Flip a TimeMachine backup's case-sensitivity flag

If you restore from this backup – even onto a case-insensitive volume –, the volume will end up
case-sensitive again. TimeMachine's restore process will recreate the volume according to the
backup's case-sensitivity marker alone. The good news: it doesn't care about the backup volume's
case-sensitivity at all. It just looks for an extended attribute inside the Backup folder.

So, even though the backup is on a case-sensitive volume, all you need to do is flip the
case-sensitivity switch like this:

```bash
$ sudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass \
    xattr -w com.apple.backupd.VolumeIsCaseSensitive 0 \
    /Volumes/TimeMachiiine/Backups.backupdb/tin/Latest/MacHD
```

Use the name of your Mac's startup volume instead of my ``MacHD``. Same goes for backup volume
and computer name.

In case you're curious what's goi ng on there: Since the backup folder is heavily ACL'd, you need to
bypass them using the ``bypass`` command like above which is shipped with the TimeMachine kernel extension.
It's present in older Mac OS versions, too, but the path may be slightly different. I'm sure
you can find it.

## 4. Restoring the backup

 1. Reboot you Mac
 1. Hold *Command-R* when the chime plays
 1. Select *Restore from TimeMachine Backup*
 1. Select the prepared backup volume
 1. Let it restore

The restore will succeed if, and only if you managed to clear all case-sensitivity conflicts before
taking the backup. If you didn't, you will need to restore that other backup that you didn't
touch, and start over. Technically you can flip back the case-sensitivity flag of the
manipulated backup using the recovery's terminal, but you'll be extremely glad to have made
a backup that is still working because you didn't break it. Believe me.

If the restore goes all the way to 100% without an error and the system finally reboots,
finally go and enjoy that crappy software that put you through all of this. ;)
